}
```

## Additional Information

Note 1: I am using the substream "Channels/2" vs main stream which is "Channels/1" since I have my main stream outputting h265. This is also why the frame size is low

Note 2: if you end up using the smtp-motion you have to give your camera a name without a space. The config on the camera wont support + in the to address.
